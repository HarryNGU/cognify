# Knowledge Map Visualization Design

## Visualization Principles
The knowledge map visualization is designed to support pattern-seeking and big-picture cognitive styles through these core principles:

1. **Hierarchical Structure with Zoom Levels**
   - Macro view: High-level domains and major concept clusters
   - Meso view: Topic areas and their interconnections
   - Micro view: Individual concepts and their immediate relationships

2. **Multiple Visualization Modes**
   - **Network Graph**: Emphasizes connections and relationships between concepts
   - **Hierarchical Tree**: Shows taxonomic relationships and concept dependencies
   - **Concept Clusters**: Groups related concepts to highlight patterns
   - **Mind Map**: Radial organization around central concepts
   - **Timeline**: Chronological arrangement for sequential concepts

3. **Visual Encoding**
   - **Node Size**: Represents concept importance or frequency
   - **Node Color**: Indicates knowledge domain or category
   - **Edge Thickness**: Shows relationship strength
   - **Edge Style**: Differentiates relationship types (prerequisite, similar, contrasting)
   - **Spatial Proximity**: Indicates conceptual closeness

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - **Zoom Controls**: Adjust detail level and focus area
   - **Filtering Panel**: Show/hide specific concept types or domains
   - **Search Function**: Locate specific concepts within the map
   - **Highlighting**: Emphasize related concepts when hovering
   - **Expansion**: Click to reveal more details about a concept
   - **Rearrangement**: Drag nodes to customize the view

## Knowledge Node Structure
Each node in the knowledge map represents a concept and contains:

1. **Core Components**
   - Concept name/title
   - Brief description
   - Domain/category classification
   - Importance rating
   - Complexity level

2. **Expandable Details**
   - Comprehensive explanation
   - Key examples
   - Visual representations
   - Source references
   - Related concepts
   - Learning resources

3. **Relationship Data**
   - Prerequisites
   - Dependencies
   - Applications
   - Similar concepts
   - Contrasting concepts

## Relationship Visualization
Relationships between concepts are visualized through:

1. **Connection Types**
   - Hierarchical (parent-child)
   - Sequential (before-after)
   - Associative (related-to)
   - Causal (leads-to)
   - Comparative (similar-to, different-from)

2. **Visual Representations**
   - Directed arrows for sequential or causal relationships
   - Undirected lines for associative relationships
   - Nested structures for hierarchical relationships
   - Parallel lines for comparative relationships

## User Interaction Flow

1. **Initial View**
   - High-level overview of the entire knowledge domain
   - Major concept clusters visibly distinguished
   - Key relationships between clusters highlighted

2. **Exploration Interactions**
   - Zoom in/out to adjust detail level
   - Pan to navigate across the map
   - Hover over nodes to see brief descriptions
   - Hover over connections to see relationship types
   - Filter to focus on specific aspects

3. **Detail Interactions**
   - Click on nodes to expand and see detailed information
   - Click on expanded nodes to initiate learning journeys
   - Double-click to center and focus on a specific area
   - Right-click for additional options (bookmark, annotate)

4. **Learning Journey Transition**
   - Visual indication of selected concept
   - Smooth transition to learning journey view
   - Highlighting of related concepts in the journey
   - Option to return to main knowledge map

## Responsive Design Considerations
The visualization adapts to different screen sizes:

1. **Desktop View**
   - Full interactive visualization with all features
   - Side panels for details and controls
   - Multiple simultaneous views possible

2. **Tablet View**
   - Simplified visualization with core features
   - Collapsible panels for details
   - Touch-optimized interaction

3. **Mobile View**
   - Focused view on specific sections of the map
   - Sequential access to detailed information
   - Simplified controls for essential interactions

## Accessibility Features
The visualization includes:

1. **Color Considerations**
   - Colorblind-friendly palette
   - Sufficient contrast ratios
   - Alternative visual encodings beyond color

2. **Interactive Assistance**
   - Text descriptions of visual patterns
   - Keyboard navigation options
   - Screen reader compatibility

3. **Cognitive Support**
   - Progressive disclosure of complex information
   - Consistent visual language
   - Clear visual hierarchy

## Technical Implementation
The visualization will be implemented using:

1. **Core Technologies**
   - D3.js for 2D network visualizations
   - Three.js for 3D visualizations when appropriate
   - SVG for high-quality vector graphics
   - HTML5 Canvas for performance with large datasets

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Level-of-detail rendering
   - Viewport culling
   - Lazy loading of detailed content
   - Web worker processing for layout algorithms
