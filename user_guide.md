# User Guide: Knowledge Map Generator

## Overview

The Knowledge Map Generator is a specialized tool designed for learners with pattern-seeking and big-picture cognitive styles. Unlike traditional linear learning approaches, this program transforms your learning materials into interactive knowledge maps that highlight connections, patterns, and relationships between concepts.

## Key Features

- **Upload Various Learning Materials**: Support for PDFs, text files, presentations, images with text, and HTML content
- **Interactive Knowledge Maps**: Visualize concepts and their relationships in multiple view modes
- **Pattern-Based Organization**: Emphasizes connections and relationships rather than linear sequences
- **Personalized Learning Journeys**: Click on any concept to generate a customized, non-linear learning path
- **Cognitive Style Optimization**: Specifically designed for pattern-seeking and big-picture understanding

## Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Run the `run.sh` script in the project directory
   - Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

2. **Upload Learning Materials**:
   - Drag and drop files into the upload area or click to select files
   - Supported formats: PDF, TXT, PPTX, HTML, JPG, PNG
   - Click "Process Materials" to begin analysis

3. **Explore the Knowledge Map**:
   - Once processing is complete, the knowledge map will appear
   - Use the zoom controls to adjust your view
   - Try different visualization modes (Network, Hierarchy, Clusters)
   - Hover over nodes to see concept details
   - Use the filter panel to focus on specific aspects

4. **Generate Learning Journeys**:
   - Click on any concept node to generate a personalized learning journey
   - The journey is tailored to pattern-seeking cognitive styles
   - Navigate through related concepts using the journey path
   - Explore connections and patterns between concepts
   - Return to the main map at any time

## Visualization Modes

- **Network View**: Shows all connections between concepts, emphasizing relationship patterns
- **Hierarchy View**: Displays concepts in a tree structure, showing taxonomic relationships
- **Cluster View**: Groups related concepts together, highlighting conceptual patterns

## Tips for Pattern-Seeking Learners

- Start with the Cluster view to identify major concept groups
- Use the Network view to explore connections between different concept clusters
- Click on central nodes (larger circles) to explore foundational concepts
- Look for concepts that connect to multiple other concepts - these often represent key patterns
- Generate learning journeys from different starting points to see how concepts connect in various ways
- Pay attention to the "Pattern Insights" section in learning journeys

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection for initial setup
- 4GB RAM or more recommended for processing large documents

## Troubleshooting

- **File Upload Issues**: Ensure files are in supported formats and under 50MB
- **Processing Delays**: Large or complex documents may take longer to process
- **Visualization Performance**: If the map becomes slow, try filtering to show fewer concepts
- **Browser Compatibility**: If experiencing issues, try a different browser

## Privacy Note

All processing happens locally on your machine. Your learning materials and generated knowledge maps are not sent to external servers.
