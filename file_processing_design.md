# File Upload and Processing System Design

## Overview
The file upload and processing system is designed to handle various learning materials, extract their content, and prepare it for knowledge mapping. This system serves as the foundation for the knowledge extraction pipeline and must be robust, efficient, and extensible.

## System Components

### 1. File Upload Interface
- **Drag-and-drop Zone**: Interactive area for file uploads
- **File Selection Dialog**: Alternative method for file selection
- **Upload Progress Indicator**: Visual feedback during upload process
- **File Type Validation**: Real-time validation of supported file types
- **Batch Upload Support**: Ability to upload multiple files simultaneously
- **File Size Handling**: Management of large file uploads with chunking

### 2. File Storage System
- **Temporary Storage**: For files during processing
- **Persistent Storage**: For processed files and extracted content
- **File Organization**: Directory structure based on user and content type
- **Metadata Storage**: Database records for file information and status
- **Version Control**: Support for multiple versions of the same material
- **Cleanup Mechanism**: Automatic removal of temporary files

### 3. File Processing Pipeline

#### 3.1 File Type Detection
- MIME type identification
- File extension validation
- Content-based verification
- Format version detection

#### 3.2 Text Extraction Modules
- **PDF Processor**:
  - Uses poppler-utils (pdftotext, pdfimages) for content extraction
  - Handles text, images, and structural elements
  - Preserves document structure when possible
  - Extracts metadata (title, author, creation date)

- **Text File Processor**:
  - Handles plain text (.txt), markdown (.md), and rich text (.rtf)
  - Encoding detection and normalization
  - Basic structure inference (headings, paragraphs)

- **Presentation Processor**:
  - Extracts content from PowerPoint (.pptx, .ppt) and similar formats
  - Preserves slide structure and organization
  - Extracts text, images, and notes
  - Maintains presentation flow information

- **Web Content Processor**:
  - Handles HTML and web archives
  - Extracts main content while filtering navigation and ads
  - Preserves hyperlink relationships
  - Captures embedded media references

- **Image Text Processor**:
  - OCR for text extraction from images
  - Caption and label detection
  - Diagram and chart recognition
  - Image classification for content relevance

- **Video Transcript Processor**:
  - Extracts or generates transcripts from video content
  - Speaker identification when available
  - Timestamp preservation for content synchronization

#### 3.3 Content Normalization
- Text encoding standardization (UTF-8)
- Whitespace and formatting normalization
- Special character handling
- Language detection and tagging
- Section and paragraph identification
- Heading level normalization

#### 3.4 Structural Analysis
- Document hierarchy extraction
- Section relationship identification
- Content flow analysis
- Reference and citation detection
- Table and list structure preservation
- Image and text relationship mapping

### 4. Processing Coordination
- **Job Queue System**: Manages processing tasks
- **Worker Pool**: Handles concurrent processing
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors progress of file processing
- **Error Handling**: Manages and reports processing failures
- **Retry Mechanism**: Attempts recovery from transient failures
- **Notification System**: Alerts when processing completes or fails

### 5. Content Preparation for Knowledge Extraction
- **Text Segmentation**: Divides content into processable chunks
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Adds context information to content
- **Format Conversion**: Transforms content into standard format for NLP
- **Index Generation**: Creates searchable indices for content
- **Reference Resolution**: Links citations to sources
- **Content Tagging**: Adds preliminary category and domain tags

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture
- File system for raw files and extracted media
- Database for metadata and processing status
- Object storage for scalability with large files
- Caching layer for frequently accessed content

### Processing Technologies
- Python-based processing pipeline
- Celery for task queue management
- Redis for job coordination
- Docker containers for isolation of processing environments
- Specialized libraries for each file type:
  - PyPDF2 and pdf2image for PDF processing
  - python-pptx for presentations
  - Beautiful Soup for HTML/web content
  - Tesseract (via pytesseract) for OCR
  - NLTK and spaCy for initial text analysis

### API Design
- RESTful API for file upload and status checking
- Webhook support for processing completion notifications
- Streaming API for real-time progress updates
- Batch API for processing multiple files

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Upload Errors
- Network interruption recovery
- Duplicate file detection
- Unsupported file type identification
- Corrupted file detection
- Size limit enforcement

### Processing Errors
- Format-specific error handling
- Processing timeout management
- Resource exhaustion handling
- Corrupt content detection
- Partial processing recovery

## Security Considerations

### File Validation
- MIME type verification
- Content scanning for malicious code
- File size limits
- Extension validation

### Content Sanitization
- HTML/script removal from text content
- Metadata scrubbing for privacy
- Personal information detection and handling
- Copyright and sensitive content detection

### Access Control
- User-specific file access
- Processing audit logs
- Content access permissions
- Encryption for sensitive materials

## Performance Optimization

### Upload Optimization
- Chunked uploads for large files
- Client-side compression
- Parallel uploads for multiple files
- Resume capability for interrupted uploads

### Processing Optimization
- Resource-based job scheduling
- Content-based prioritization
- Incremental processing for large files
- Caching of intermediate results
- Parallel processing where applicable

## Extensibility

### Plugin Architecture
- File type handler plugins
- Processing step plugins
- Content analyzer plugins
- Output formatter plugins

### Integration Points
- External OCR services
- Cloud-based processing services
- Third-party content analysis tools
- Learning management system connectors
