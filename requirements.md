# Knowledge Map Program Requirements

## Cognitive Style Focus
The program is specifically designed for learners with a cognitive style primed for:
- Pattern seeking and recognition
- Big picture understanding
- Non-linear learning approaches
- Conceptual connections and relationships
- Visual-spatial reasoning

## Learning Materials Support
The program should support uploading and processing of various learning materials:
- PDF documents (textbooks, research papers, articles)
- Text files (course notes, transcripts)
- Web pages (online resources, articles)
- Presentations (PowerPoint, Google Slides)
- Video transcripts (lecture recordings, tutorials)
- Images with text content

## Knowledge Extraction Requirements
- Automatic extraction of key concepts from uploaded materials
- Identification of relationships between concepts
- Recognition of hierarchical structures within the content
- Detection of cross-disciplinary connections
- Extraction of supporting examples and applications
- Identification of prerequisite knowledge

## Knowledge Map Visualization
- Interactive, zoomable visualization
- Hierarchical and network-based representation
- Visual distinction between different types of concepts
- Indication of relationship strength between concepts
- Color coding for different knowledge domains or categories
- Support for multiple visualization modes (tree, network, cluster)
- Ability to filter and focus on specific areas of the knowledge map

## Interactive Features
- Clickable nodes that expand to reveal detailed information
- Ability to zoom in/out to see different levels of detail
- Search functionality to locate specific concepts
- Filtering options to focus on specific aspects of the knowledge
- User annotation capabilities
- Customizable views based on user preferences
- Ability to save and share knowledge maps

## Learning Journey Generation
- Non-linear pathways through the knowledge map
- Personalized learning sequences based on cognitive style
- Alternative paths for exploring the same content
- Highlighting of patterns and connections between concepts
- Integration of diverse learning resources for each concept
- Adaptive progression based on user interaction
- Emphasis on conceptual understanding over rote memorization

## User Experience Requirements
- Intuitive and visually appealing interface
- Minimal learning curve for basic functionality
- Responsive design for different devices
- Clear visual feedback for user interactions
- Progress tracking and bookmarking
- Engaging and stimulating presentation of content
- Accessibility considerations for diverse users
