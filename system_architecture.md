# System Architecture Design

## Overview
The Knowledge Map Program is designed as a web application with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for scalability. The system will process uploaded learning materials, extract knowledge structures, generate interactive visualizations, and create personalized learning journeys.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Interface
- **Upload Module**: Handles file uploads and initial processing
- **Visualization Module**: Renders interactive knowledge maps using D3.js/Three.js
- **Interaction Module**: Manages user interactions with the knowledge map
- **Learning Journey Module**: Presents personalized learning paths
- **User Preferences Module**: Stores and applies user customization settings

### 2. Backend Services
- **File Processing Service**: Extracts text and structure from various file formats
- **Knowledge Extraction Service**: Identifies concepts, relationships, and patterns
- **Map Generation Service**: Transforms extracted knowledge into visual structures
- **Learning Path Service**: Creates non-linear learning journeys based on the knowledge map
- **Storage Service**: Manages persistence of maps, user preferences, and materials

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Text Extraction**: Converts various file formats to processable text
- **Natural Language Processing**: Identifies key concepts and relationships
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Builds a structured representation of knowledge
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies higher-level patterns and connections
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Adds additional context and categorization

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js for component-based UI development
- **Visualization**: D3.js for 2D visualizations, Three.js for 3D visualizations
- **State Management**: Redux for application state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

### Backend
- **Server**: Flask (Python) for API endpoints and service coordination
- **NLP Processing**: spaCy and NLTK for natural language processing
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Custom algorithms + transformer models for concept extraction
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for consistent environments
- **API Gateway**: For service coordination and client communication
- **Storage**: File system for uploaded materials, database for extracted knowledge

## Data Flow

1. **Material Upload**: User uploads learning materials through the web interface
2. **Text Extraction**: Backend extracts text content from various file formats
3. **Knowledge Processing**: NLP pipeline identifies concepts, relationships, and patterns
4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: System builds a structured representation of the content
5. **Visualization Generation**: Frontend renders the knowledge map based on the graph data
6. **User Interaction**: User explores the knowledge map through interactive features
7. **Learning Journey Creation**: When a node is clicked, the system generates a personalized learning path
8. **Content Presentation**: The system presents relevant content along the learning journey

## Design Considerations

### Cognitive Style Support
- Multiple visualization modes to support different pattern recognition preferences
- Hierarchical zooming to facilitate big-picture understanding
- Visual cues for relationships and patterns
- Interactive elements that reveal connections and dependencies

### Scalability
- Modular architecture allows for component-level scaling
- Asynchronous processing for handling large documents
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed knowledge maps

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for adding new file format support
- API-driven design allows for future integration with other learning systems
- Customizable visualization templates
